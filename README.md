WebRTC Recorder
===============

This is a little project to build a WebRTC recorder using the latest web technologies

Chrome can record video, so the purpose of this is to implement a video recorder that allows playback from multiple videos with a delay

This has been attempted to be ported (successfully!) to electron, checkout: https://github.com/ayroblu/webrecElectron

Note, chrome has an issue in this [link](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606000)

TODO
----
* Selection of videos
* Update to webpack and modern build tools and ES2017
